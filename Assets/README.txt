Hello user!
Guide on how to use this:
1. Go to Assets/Scenes/ and launch the MainMenu scene
2. Select what type of algorithm you want to use 
   (To use DFS you have to switch off it and switch back)
3. Select the maze size, for example: 20 will create a 20x20 grid maze
4. Select your type of agent that you want to use 
   (if No Agent is selected, fille the num of agent field with 0)
   (when using both, it will use 50/50 of the num of agents)
5. Select the amount of agents you want
   (If agent type is "both" and you write 10 agents, 
   5 will be close and 5 will be open with priority for close)
6. In the bottom right you can select if you want the agent to run 
   through the maze or if you want to run through it
7. Press start and enjoy! :)
